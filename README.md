# IBM-HR-Employee-Attrition
## Project for the Data Mining course @ University of Pisa
Analysis aimed at uncovering the factors that lead to employee attrition. More informations can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset

The paper is splitted into the following tasks:
- <b>Data Understanding</b> and assessing of data quality
- <b>Visualization</b> of the Distribution of the variables and statistics
- <b>Clustering</b> Analysis by K-Means, Density-based and Hierarchical clustering
- <b>Classification</b> by Decision Tree (SDT,ODT model), Random Forest and K-NN
- <b>Pattern Mining</b>: discovering frequent patterns and association rules with Apriori alghoritm.

## Objectives
Recent tremendous technical advances in processing power, storage capacity, and interconnectivity are creating unprecedented quantities of digital data. Data mining, the
science of extracting useful knowledge from such huge data repositories, has emerged as an interdisciplinary field in computer science. Data mining techniques have
been widely applied to problems in industry, science, engineering and government,
and it is believed that data mining will have profound impact on our society. The
course is divided into two modules. The first presents an introduction to the basic
concepts of data mining and the knowledge discovery process, and associated analytical models and algorithms. The second module provides an account of advanced
techniques for analysis and mining of novel forms of data, and the main application
areas and prototypical case studies.
